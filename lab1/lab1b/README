#Based on the discussion with one of the TAs on the log and the post on piazza about project1b, I set my program such that it will read the input one-by-one, echo to the terminal, log each character as "SENT 1 byte: [a-z]", and send it to the socket. Upon receiving the results from socket, my program read the results one-by-one, send it to the terminal one-by-one, and log each character as "RECEIVED 1 byte: [a-z]". 

#There should be ways to modified the log process. I will send the updates once I finish

#In the encryption mode, the character is encrypted one by one using twofish algorithm and CFB mode. 

#my.key is the key used for encryption. It has to be at least 20 characters.  
#In the makefile, default will generate both executables for server.c and client.c. make client will generate client executable and make server will generate server executable.

#When running the program. Make sure both executables are on the same machine. Open two terminal windows. Be sure to run the server first then the client.
