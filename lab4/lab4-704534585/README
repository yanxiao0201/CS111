1) lab4a.c: files for first part
2) lab4b.c: files for second part, no DISPLAY mode
3) lcd.c lcd.h: library files for the extra credit. I have managed to show the temperature
   on the lcd. The library files were originally found on line and I modified them.
   So in order for the extra credit requirements, lab4a.c and lcd.c have to compile togehter

4) lab4a is the executable for part1, lab4b is the executable for part2
5) I have no time to implement the extra credit for part2. But it should be easy
